# CW-Competition-Base

This is the base package for creating modular cw-competitions. It provides the functionality to create, manage, and interact with arena competition modules. The main contract file `contract.rs` contains the core logic for managing competitions, including functions for creating competitions, submitting evidence, activating and jailing competitions, and more. It also handles the distribution of rewards and the interaction with escrow contracts.
